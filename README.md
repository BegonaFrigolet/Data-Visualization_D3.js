# Beautifying Pregnancy Data

The purpose of this project is to transform the data presented in a bar chart into something more interactive while at the same time keeping the main message. To be able to come up with this final result, We combined various sources with the main ones being a tutorial from FlowingData showing us of to do such a visualization.([the link to the tutorial i] (https://flowingdata.com/2016/08/23/make-a-moving-bubbles-chart-to-show-clustering-and-distributions/) and a graph tweeted by [Caitlin Huton.](https://twitter.com/beeonaposy/status/1215830967719485441)

## Data:
The data of the animation can be found in this [Link](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mohamedkhanafer/c98be5b6981264a6d8054a0ae0436898/raw/e620fb6a09bd9a0e8f501d2de4ba93104622610c/gistfile1.txt)

## Final Visualization: 
The result with animations can be found in this [Link](https://blockbuilder.org/BegonaFrigolet/b3006c70427e0a58f2b43bc44dcc3bc1), to learn more about D3 it is recommended to go through the explanations as well as the visualizations.
